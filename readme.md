Steps to add Members from one channel to another channel in Telegram -_-

Note -- This tutorial is for PC / Laptop



Step 1 :  Download all files in this repository.

Install Python from here --> https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.4/python-3.11.4-amd64.exe


Step 2 :  Make sure all the files in same folder. (You can also move these 3 files in a seperate new folder for easy process but it is optional)


Step 3 :  Open the 4th Downloaded file which is to install Python in Windows.

After opening the 4th file to install Python, Make sure to select the last checkbox also which says ADD PYTHON.EXE TO PATH.


Step 4 :  Click on install now and then click on DISABLE PATH LIMIT after the installation and close.


Step 5 :  Open Config file and enter your Telegram Account API_ID , API_HASH & PHONE_NUMBER

You can get API_ID and API_HASH from https://my.telegram.org/auth

You must login only that mobile number details which is Owner/Admin in channel because only he has member adding permissions enabled.

Replace the old values with your own Values of API_ID , API_HASH, PHONE_NUMBER.



Step 6 :  Open the 1st downloaded file whose name is MAIN
          it is a BAT file to execute commands automatically.

Step 7 :  When it says, PLEASE ENTER YOUR PHONE , enter your mobile number of Telegram account which is Owner / Admin of the channel.


Step 8 :  Enter the OTP and then select your Channel and the channel that you want to scrape members from.
